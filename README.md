This directory includes scripts that were used to produce results for the following manuscript:

Hernandez RD, Uricchio LH, Hartman K, Ye C, Dahl A, Zaitlen N. Ultra-rare variants drive substantial cis-heritability of human gene expression (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/12/15/219238).

Unfortunately, much of this code is not plug and play. Several scripts are geared toward a particular data structure with hard coded directories. However, the code is being made available to make it clear exactly what was done to produce the results. Any questions should be addressed to Ryan Hernandez <ryan.hernandez@me.com>.
